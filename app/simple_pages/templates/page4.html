        The Single Responsibility Principle: The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a
        single reason to change. To state this principle more technically: Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic, and so on.)
        in the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
        This means that if a class is a data container, like a Book class or a Student class, and it has some fields
        regarding that entity, it should change only when we change the data model.
        Following the Single Responsibility Principle is important. First of all, because many different teams can work
        on the same project and edit the same class for different reasons, this could lead to incompatible modules.
        Second, it makes version control easier. For example, say we have a persistence class that handles database
        operations, and we see a change in that file in the GitHub commits. By following the SRP, we will know that it
        is related to storage or database-related stuff.
        Merge conflicts are another example. They appear when different teams change the same file. But if the SRP is
        followed, fewer conflicts will appear – files will have a single reason to change, and conflicts that do exist
        will be easier to resolve.

        Open-Closed Principle:The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
        Modification means changing the code of an existing class, and extension means adding new functionality.
        So what this principle wants to say is: We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing
        code for the class. This is because whenever we modify the existing code, we are taking the risk of creating
        potential bugs. So we should avoid touching the tested and reliable (mostly) production code if possible.
        But how are we going to add new functionality without touching the class, you may ask. It is usually done with
        the help of interfaces and abstract classes. Now that we have covered the basics of the principle, let's apply it to our Invoice application.
        Let's say our boss came to us and said that they want invoices to be saved to a database so that we can search
        them easily.

        Liskov Substitution Principle: The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.
        This means that, given that class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to pass an object of class B to
        any method that expects an object of class A and the method should not give any weird output in that case.
        This is the expected behavior, because when we use inheritance we assume that the child class inherits
        everything that the superclass has. The child class extends the behavior but never narrows it down.
        Therefore, when a class does not obey this principle, it leads to some nasty bugs that are hard to detect.
        Liskov's principle is easy to understand but hard to detect in code.

        Interface Segregation Principle: Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the
        interfaces.The principle states that many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface. Clients
        should not be forced to implement a function they do no need.

        Dependency Inversion Principle: The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes
        instead of concrete classes and functions. In his article (2000), Uncle Bob summarizes this principle as follows:
        "If the OCP states the goal of OO architecture, the DIP states the primary mechanism".
        These two principles are indeed related and we have applied this pattern before while we were discussing the
        Open-Closed Principle.We want our classes to be open to extension, so we have reorganized our dependencies to depend on interfaces
        instead of concrete classes. Our PersistenceManager class depends on InvoicePersistence instead of the classes
        that implement that interface.
